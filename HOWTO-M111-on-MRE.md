Getting started with the W202 ME2.1 ECU connector

This ECU has a CAR connector with 145 pins that you can find it [here](Images/MB_ME2.1.jpeg)

How to read the following table:

Connector : Connector from A to F on the harness.

Pin: Pin number of the connector.

Name: this field was filled from the M111.921 wiring diagram.

Function: some human readbale text.

ME2.1 Description: Based on me2.1 documenation what i have found for Alfa Rome.

MRE pin: Where to connect the pin (wiring example).

Comments: extra info that i learned during wiring in the ECU.
