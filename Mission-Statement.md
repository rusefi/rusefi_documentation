# rusEFI Mission Statement

rusEFI is a group of enthusiasts developing a fundamentally _smarter_ open-source standalone engine control unit for internal combustion engines.
We have built an amazing foundation which is good enough to run any simple engine.
Current software and universal hardware offerings aim to cater to those interested in further development.
