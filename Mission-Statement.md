# rusEFI Mission Statement

TL,DR: always looking for C/C++/PHP/Java developers!

rusEFI is a group of enthusiasts developing a fundamentally _smarter_ open source ECU.
As of 2022, we have built an amazing foundation which is good enough to run any simple engine as is.
Current software and universal hardware and offerings aim to cater to those interested in further development.
