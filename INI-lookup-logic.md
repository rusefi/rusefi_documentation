# .ini Lookup Logic

All official rusEFI .ini files are available at https://rusefi.com/online/ini/

Dots should be replaced with slash and the `.ini` suffix should be added.

For instance, the .ini file for `rusEFI master.2024.02.02.alphax-4chan.1293678056`
would be available at https://rusefi.com/online/ini/rusefi/master/2024/02/02/alphax-4chan/1293678056.ini
