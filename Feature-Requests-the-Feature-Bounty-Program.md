The challenge of rusEFI as of 2020 is the fact that hardware is way ahead of software at this point. With just a few programmers and the complexity of the project, it would be a while until normal users would be benefiting from rusEFI because of the complexity and knowledge required.

But if for any reason you would prefer to use rusEFI and look for any specific feature, money can probably help you!
