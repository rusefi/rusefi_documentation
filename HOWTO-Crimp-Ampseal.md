If your pins are not loose, use nice wire cutters to separate individual terminals from the loom - do not bend break terminals from the loom.

Pop red wedge lock up into "insertion position" - do not remove red wedge lock completely. You only need to remove red wedge lock completely in case of emergency if normal de-pinning does not work.

While Matt says to only strip 3mm of the wire, Andrey would strip TDB length (about 8mm?) so that you can hit the round cap on the terminal. Having the wire bottoming out allows for a quicker crimping by simplifying wire positioning.
