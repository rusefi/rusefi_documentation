# HOWTO Crimp Ampseal

[AMPSEAL Connector Video Tutorial](https://youtu.be/24bNFu7a9lc)

If your pins are not loose, use nice wire cutters to separate individual terminals from the loom - do not break terminals from the loom by bending.

Pop the red wedge lock up into the "insertion position" - do not remove the red wedge lock completely. You only need to remove the red wedge lock completely in case of emergency if normal de-pinning does not work.

As you can see in the image below, TE specifies 5.1 +- 0.4 mm of strip length, but you can probably get by with as little as 3, and you may find it easier to strip more so that you can hit the round cap on the terminal. Having the wire bottoming out allows for a quicker crimping by simplifying wire positioning.
