# Plug and Play

* Uses OEM header (new if available, used otherwise)
* Goes into OEM case
* Basic CAN programming included according to provided CAN message format

* TL,DR: this is a _blank_ PnP _board_ not a "Hook it up and drive to the race track" deal. Please do your research!

# What next?

rusEFI LLC does not have experience and resources to provide adequate support to retail customers. The ideal setup is rusEFI focusing on hardware, software and fabrication, with _product owners_ dealing with sales, marketing and user support for each of the platform specific ECUs.
