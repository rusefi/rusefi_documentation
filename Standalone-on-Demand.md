# Plug In, not Plug and Play

* Uses OEM header (new if available, used otherwise)
* Goes into OEM case
* Basic CAN programming included according to provided CAN message format
* Tuning NOT included
* K-line NOT supported
* Vehicle integration research NOT included
* TL,DR: this is a _blank_ plug-in _board_ not a "Hook it up and drive to the race track" deal. While we can produce a great ECU, only someone with a test vehicle can make the base tune. Please do your research!

# What next?

rusEFI LLC does not have experience and resources to provide adequate support to retail customers. The ideal setup is rusEFI focusing on hardware, software and fabrication, with _product owners_ dealing with sales, marketing and user support for each of the platform specific ECUs.
