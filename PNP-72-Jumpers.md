## Jumpers required for some years of Miata NB

It has come to light that some years of NB series Miatas require the installation of a jumper wire to power up the PNP board.
Currently we are aware that the 2001 requires pin 4AF and 4S to be jumpered.
This can be done by installing a wire between the holes available on W4AF1 and W4S1.

2001 NB Miata
