# Nano TCU Gateway

* [⏩ Interactive Pinout ⏪](https://rusefi.com/docs/pinouts/nano-tcu/)
* Available at the [rusEFI store](https://www.shop.rusefi.com/shop/p/tcu-nano)
* The job of the gateway is to feed all needed data into the OEM TCU for it to function without the rest of the original electronics.
* It's not a standalone TCU: The OEM TCU controls the transmission solenoids.
* Looks similar to [nano ECU](nano), but that's a totally different thing 😀
* [GM 6L](GM-6L) beta version
* GM 8L beta version
* [8HP](8hp) coming soon!
