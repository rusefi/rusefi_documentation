# Nano TCU Gateway

* [⏩ Interactive Pinout ⏪](https://rusefi.com/docs/pinouts/nano-tcu/)
* the job of the gateway is to feed all needed data into the OEM TCU for it to function without the rest of original electronics.
* It's not a standalone TCU: OEM TCU controls the solenoids transmission
* looks similar to [nano ECU](nano), but that's a totally different thing 😀
* GM 8L beta version
* [GM 6L](GM-6L) beta version
* [8HP](8HP) coming soon!
