This is a bundle of all our discussed but no time to do ideas.

- MS DBW extension mode - Simple mode to can interface with a MS unit and provide drive by wire capability.

- Piggy back mode - something to help with integration of an MRE or similar in a piggyback config in situations where an OEM ECU must be retained either due to complexity or emissions testing.
Perhaps this could include a pass through for the crank sensor and spoofing of some outputs to keep the OEM ecu happy?
