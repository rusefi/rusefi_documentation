# rusEFI Android App

The rusEFI Android App is part of the [rusEFI Online](Online) suite. The primary job of rusEFI Android app is to provide the rusEFI ECU with remote tuning capability.

One day we will publish rusEFI Android on the Google Play store but for now you would have to install it using [rusEFI-release.apk](https://github.com/rusefi/rusefi/releases/download/release_230604/rusEFI-release.apk)

You will have to enable installing application not from Play Store and you will probably have to disable Google Play Protect.

*__Q:__ How do I disable "Google Play Protect"?*  
__A:__ On Android >= 8
Settings => Apps => Google Play Store => Notifications => High priority => Turn OFF

On Android <= 7
Settings => Notifications => Google Play Store => Block all
