## Please do good and do not do bad

We hope that as a community we can leverage each other's skills and have peaceful fun together.

We probably would not articulate the guiding principles better than https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/blob/master/docs/development/Development.md and https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md
