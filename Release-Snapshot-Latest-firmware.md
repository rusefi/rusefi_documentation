# Firmware Versions

## Release

The firmware version that has been more thoroughly tested.

## Snapshot

Potentially less stable version with all the most recent changes, sometimes known as "beta version".

## Latest

"latest" is a bad term since it could be either "latest release" or "latest snapshot".
