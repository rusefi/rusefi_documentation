# Stepper Motor

Let's be clear: stepper motor is our least favorite idle air valve option. We are not excited about it at all.

microRusEFI can control 4 wire using on-board TLE8888 see https://github.com/rusefi/rusefi/pull/3749

uaEFI and Proteus can control 4 wire using two h-bridges/DC motor drivers
