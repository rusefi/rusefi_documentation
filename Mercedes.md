[Hellen 128 Mercedes](Hellen-128-Mercedes) is the easiest option if your vehicle has matching harness (ME 2.0/2.1)

[microRusEFI](microRusEFI-Manual) smaller universal ECU should be enough for 4 cylinder applications, harness modification required.

[Proteus](Proteus-Manual) has enough outputs to handle even simpler 12 cylinder engines, harness modification required.
