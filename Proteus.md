Q: where can I buy a Proteus?

A: as of July 11, 2020 no one sells fully assembled Proteus boards.

With fabrication files for Proteus you can get a 80% assembled unit from JLCPCB. QTY 2 price XXX, QTY 10 price YYY.
While the most complicated main chip is soldered you would still solder a few dozens of surface mount components.
