# I Have an Idea

*__Q:__ I have an amazing idea, let's do X! I bet it's possible with existing rusEFI software and hardware! Why not start right now?*  
__A:__ Let me answer this universal question with a universal answer, in two parts:

1. Shortage of available resources (mostly software developers and testers)
2. How can *you* help with this proposal or [in general](HOWTO-help-rusEFI)?

*__Q:__ Is it possible to do X?*  
__A:__ The moon landing was possible more than 50 years ago! A *lot* of things are possible with proper resource allocation. If you can engineer it, go for it! If you are asking for help, we offer commercial engineering services. See [Standalone on Demand](Standalone-on-Demand) and [Royalty](Royalty).
