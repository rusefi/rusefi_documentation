## First things first

It is important for a new user to understand some things about rusEFI before jumping into the hardware or software.

RusEFI is a community project, everyone here is giving there time for free and have normal day jobs, this limits the amount of direct support we can give.
This means that the wiki and forum should be the first port of call for any questions. Most things are covered within these two resources.  
With this in mind it is important that new users take a quick look at the [D is for distraction](D-is-for-DISTRACTION) page and the [What rusEFI cannot do](What-rusEFI-Cannot-Do)

RusEFI is an advance system, many of the features of rusEFI are things you will only find on high end or OEM ECUs. This means that users will need to take time to understand the systems they are working on and the principals behind them, a lot of the information provided is based on the concept of "helping you to help yourself".
You will be expected to put in the time to find information on the sensors you are using and any vehicle specific requirements of your install. (Though the team will always help where they can).

RusEFI is also still very much in development, the dev team provide no guarantee that any of the current features are fully working. It is important that users take a good look at the [current development status](Dev-Status) page. This is what we consider the most comprehensive list of the status of all the features of the rusEFI system.
