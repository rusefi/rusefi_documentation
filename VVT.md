rusEFI has proper closed-loop VVT valve control. VVT valve closed-loop is implemented via FSIO which is
not the best usability experience.

 
At the moment VVT trigger options are one-tooth or Miata NB2. Some software clean-up needs to happen
to start supporting more trigger options.


At the moment rusEFI has only one channel of VVT position input.
