There are two kinds of 121 connectors which look pretty much the same but do not mate together unless you use a grinder to massage them a bit.

## How to make a German plug work with an Asian header

Use a grinder on the plug. This would probably void your warranty.

Before grinding:

![Before Shaving](Hardware/connectors/before_shaving.jpg)

Take the orange rubber piece away while grinding. Grind a bit on the inside.

![After Shaving](Hardware/connectors/after_shaving.jpg)

Re-install the rubber ring.

This way you should be able to use a "German" style plug on a "Asian" style connector.
