Unified rusEfi firmware runs on wide array of boards with stm32f4 and stm32f7 microcontrollers.
We also have Kinetis and Cypres prototypes.

As of March 2020 microRusEfi is is sold as completely ready to run ECU or as a pre-assmbled 80% complete kit.

As of March 2020 Frankenso board is sold as mostly as a DIY kit.

Q: How to select a board?

A: History shows that fully assembled boards are the safest way to start. History shows
that 80% of the kits are never assembled. As of March 2020 we have many microRusEfi [in stock](https://rusefi.com/shop/) and
very remaining [old stock assembled Frankenso](https://www.tindie.com/stores/russian/). New fabrication of assembled Frankenso is
currently not planned.

Q: What else matters?

A: Types and total count of crank and camshaft positions sensors is the next
important question. microRusEfi unfortunately only supports one VR shaft input maximum with two inputs total. 

Frankenso supports up to 2 VR or 2 Hall shaft position sensors. Prometheus supports TBD. Proteus supports TBD.

Q: why stm32?
