# FAQ

Q: How about 6 cylinders sequential on microRusEfi?

A: The microRusEFI ECU is primarily a 4 cylinder ECU. At this time the testing for safety, reliable control, and consistency have not been completed for running the microRusEFI ECU on a 6 cylinder engine. This is something that we are working on and could be added at a future point.
