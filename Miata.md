# Mazda Miata

We have proven open source designs for all NA and NB pinouts. Currently we do not fabricate or stock those but can help with bulk orders.

First and second generation Miatas have used four major pinouts; this page goes into some details of each of four cases:

## Miata NA6 and early NA8

[Hellen-One-Platform](Hellen-One-Platform)

## Late NA8

While the 1996 and 1997 connector looks the same, the pinout is drastically different from the early NA8.

## Early NB

While the NB1 1999-2000 connector still looks similar, it's another different pinout.
