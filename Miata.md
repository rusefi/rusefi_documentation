# Mazda Miata

Since day one rusEFI had considerations for Plug&Play usage on Mazda Miata MX5.

First and second generation Miata have used for major pinouts, this page goes into some details of each of four cases:

## Miata NA6 and early NA8

[Hellen-One-Platform](Hellen-One-Platform)

## Late NA8

1996 and 1997 while connector looks the same, the pinout is drastically different from early NA8

## Early NB

NB1 1999-2000 while connector still looks similar that's another different pinout.
