# Unsaved Changes Indicator

*__Q:__ What does the "unsaved changes" indicator mean?*  
__A:__ Most rusEFI units cannot save the calibration into internal storage while the engine is running.  
If you need to stop the engine without killing power to the ECU we have a 'bench test'->'stop engine' button to do exactly that.
