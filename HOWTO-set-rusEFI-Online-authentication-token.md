# How to Set rusEFI Online Authentication Token

In order for your rusEFI console to upload your tune to rusEFI Online, you will need to configure your rusEFI console authentication token.

Please open your rusEFI Forum profile, ["Your Vehicles" tab](https://rusefi.com/forum/ucp.php?i=254) - and you will fix the auth token value there. Copy it from the forum profile into rusEFI console settings - and now your local console can upload to the website!

Do not share your authentication token - it yours and yours only, that's how the system establishes the tune owner.
