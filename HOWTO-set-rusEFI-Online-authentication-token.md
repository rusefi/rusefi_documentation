In order for your rusEFI console to upload your tune to rusEFI online you will need to configure rusEFI console authentication token.

Please open your rusEFI Forum profile, ["Your Vehicles" tab](https://rusefi.com/forum/ucp.php?i=254) - and you will fix the auth token value there. Copy it from the forum profile into rusEFI console settings - and now your local console can upload to the website!

Do not share your authentication token - it yours and yours only, that's how to system establishes the tune owner.
