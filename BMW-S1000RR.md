# BMW-S1000RR

## Intro

The [BMW S1000RR Motorcycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_S1000RR#:~:text=BMW%20S1000RR%20is%20a%20race,engine%20redlined%20at%2014%2C200%20rpm.) was originally released in 2009. It is a 999cc four cylinder engine making 180-200hp depending on the model year. There have been a few changes over the years, but the general architecture remains the same.

## Overview

Model years vary in their engine configuration somewhat:

* 2009-2014 models used virtually the same engine, sensors, etc.
* 2015-2018 had some minor engine updates, put out a little more power.
* 2019 had entirely new engine that is more compact and has dual camshaft profiles that can be switched (similar to Honda VTEC).

2009-2018 Engine Configuration

* 999cc four cylinder engine with 4 valves per cylinder
* 4x individual smart coil on plug ignition
* 8x injectors with one set at the ports, one set in the airbox firing into the trumpets
* Dual position variable length runner intake manifold with an actuator that changes between two different trumpet lengths
* Electronic throttle (different between 2009-2014 and 2015-2019, -2014 has cables going to TPS mounted on throttles, 2015-2018 has no cables and has encoder on throttle control)
* Two VR sensors are used for engine sensing, one on crank one on exhaust camshaft
* Crank uses a 60-2 trigger wheel
* Camshaft has a single tooth wheel
* Quickshift strain gauge sensor in the linkage allowing the ECU to sense shift forces
* 2x Variable Exhaust Actuators (not documented here)
