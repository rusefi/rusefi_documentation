# Shadow Dash

Shadow Dash can be downloaded [from EFI Analytics](http://www.tunerstudio.com/index.php/products/shadowdashmsmenu).

In order to use Shadow Dash with rusEFI, you would need to copy rusefi.ini file into the .efiAnalytics/config/ecuDef folder on your Android device and rename it to 'unknown.ini'

I've used ES File Explorer since Windows does not show hidden folders and .efiAnalytics is a hidden folder. In ES File Explorer settings I have the 'show hidden files' checkbox enabled.
