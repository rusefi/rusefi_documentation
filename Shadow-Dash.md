# Shadow Dash

In order to use Shadow Dash with rusEFI, you would need to copy rusefi.ini file into .efiAnalytics\config\ecuDef folder on your Android device and rename it to 'unknown.ini'

I've used ES File Explorer since Windows does not show hidden folders - and .efiAnalytics is a hidden folder. In ES File Explorer settings I have 'show hidden files' checkbox enabled.
