## FAQ

Q: How do I order from Europe?

A: https://shop.rusefi.com is the only official store, there are no distributors for this ultra affordable unit.

Q: Can it do 8x8?

A: You would have to remove two flyback diodes to have 8 similar injector outputs. You would have to figure out a way to have 8 equal coil outputs, maybe settle on wasted spark?

### Q: what's the difference between normal and PRO?

A: 97% of users should go with Normal. PRO can do much more complex Lua scripts.

Q: Do you have any dealer prices or discount for companies?

A: There is too little profit margin on these to offer discounts sorry.
PCB files are available for free you should be able to order your own, paid consulting is available on how to set things up with JLCPCB if you need help.

Q: How do I use uaEFI with dumb coils?

A: See notes on the schematics, it has part numbers to add and reference numbers to remove!

Q: Would it run v12?

A: definitely would idle v12, not sure if thermal would be a problem at higher RPM with two injectors per channel

Q: How do I add bluetooth?

A: See https://github.com/rusefi/rusefi/wiki/Bluetooth#jdy

Q: Where do I buy igniters?

A: See https://www.findchips.com/search/ISL9V3040D for stock at distributors

Q: Stepper?

A: yes possible
