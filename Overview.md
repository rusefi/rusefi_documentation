Hello and welcome!

You have found the rusEFI wiki main page. Here you will find information related to rusEFI, a GPL open-source engine control unit for gasoline port-injected internal combustion engines. This project involves embedded hardware, software, and engines (vroom vroom). This community has many members from many walks of life who are scattered all around the world.

**This project is NOT for emissions regulated or safety regulated applications. This project is for race cars, snow blowers, fixed engine applications, and science experiments.**


In order to use rusEFI you would need to acquire or fabricate one of the [supported boards](Hardware). You can also design you custom board if desired.

You can use rusEFI PC simulator to try rusEfi. PC simulator Windows binaries are included into [rusEFI Bundle](Download), Unix version of PC simulator could be compiled from [source code](https://github.com/rusefi/rusefi/tree/master/simulator).


## Features

1. Batch and Individual injection on gasoline engines up to 12 cylinders.

2. Wasted and Sequential ignition on gasoline engines up to 12 cylinders.

3. [Acceleration enrichment - wall wetting/fuel trip/tau factor.](wall_wetting)



**As of April 2020 rusEFI has not yet had following features:**
1. rusEFI has not yet been used to manage a diesel engine.

2. rusEFI has not yet been used to manage a direct injection gasoline engine.

3. rusEFI has not yet been used to manage an automatic transmission.

**These are all things that would be amazing to see! IF YOU have a project that includes any of those configurations or anything else, please jump in on the forums and we can work together to make it happen! 👍
