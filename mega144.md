Superior sibling of [mega100](mega100) for lqft100 version - extra performance and extra memory for extra Lua scripting.

## MOSFETs

* STP62NS04Z 🔴 not compatible https://www.st.com/resource/en/datasheet/stp62ns04z.pdf

## FAQ

*__Q:__ Is it safe to connect a 0–5v Hall input directly?*  
__A:__ Many stm32 input pins are 5v tolerant.

*__Q:__ International shipping costs more than one board?*  
__A:__ A great reason to order multiple boards and split shipping with your friends! International shipping is annoying for us as well.
