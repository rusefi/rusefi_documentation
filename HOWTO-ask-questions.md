# Asking for help

Before getting in touch for some assistance there are a couple of things to know that will make it easy for us to help you.

First off before asking for help, please check the rest of the [wiki,](HOWTO-Search-on-rusEFI-wiki) Take a look through the [forum](https://rusefi.com/forum)/search.php) or read through the [FAQs.](Pages-FAQ-and-HOWTO)

If after that you still need direct help then please have a read of the information below and help us to help you.

## Please post your tune & log files at [rusEFI Online](Online). More on that in [Support](Support)

---

## Please post details on resolution

Once your issue is resolved please write up how you got things resolved.

## Persistence

[https://rusefi.com/forum](https://rusefi.com/forum) and [https://github.com/rusefi/](https://github.com/rusefi/) are two permanent systems of record for any rusEFI knowledge. rusEFI Slack does NOT keep history. Anything you say on Slack would get hidden after about 15 days. All valuable data and content has to be persisted outside of Slack.

## Please record and post a relevant log file. There are two ways to get a log file

 1) In TunerStudio, Use "DataLogging">"Start Logging" menu item. Logs are written to "Documents\TunerStudioProjects\NAME_OF_YOUR_PROJECT\DataLogs" folder.

 2) With rusEFI console, simply grab the latest .msl file from "out" folder
