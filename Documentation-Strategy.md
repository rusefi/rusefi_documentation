As of January, 2022 the strategy is to move from [Github Wiki](https://github.com/rusefi/rusefi/wiki/) to
(https://wiki.rusefi.com)[https://wiki.rusefi.com], while still maintaining backwards compatibility with the Github wiki.


Arguments against github
1. [Not crawlable by search engines](https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues/1683)
2. Weird workflow with two separate git repositories
3. Weird inconsistency of markup language between two git repositories


# Side note

Open question what is in scope of rusEFI wiki and what is out of scope.

* We are probably not trying to teach people how to tune HP Academy does that better
* Andrey does not believe in text documentation on wiki
