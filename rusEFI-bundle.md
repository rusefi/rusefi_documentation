# rusEFI Bundle

The `rusefi.bin` file is compiled rusEFI firmware. Sometimes you would have a `rusefi_no_asserts.bin` variation of this file with fewer safety checks.

`rusefi.dfu` is also compiled rusEFI firmware, which is used for the DFU mode of flashing.

`rusefi.ini` is the TunerStudio definition file, which you would use if you use TunerStudio software to tune your rusEFI ECU.
