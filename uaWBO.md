# uaWBO

Compact WBO controller with both CAN and analog output. *Uses [lambda-x2 firmware](https://github.com/rusefi/wideband/releases/tag/2024-placeholder), overall this is a truncated compact edition of [lambda-x2](https://github.com/rusefi/rusefi-hardware/tree/main/lambda-x2).*

Available at [💲rusEFI Store 💲](https://www.shop.rusefi.com/shop/p/uawbo)

One of a few unified [rusEFI Wideband Controllers](rusEFI-Wideband-Controller)

Only 4.9 for now - we maybe know how to control 4.2 and ADV, but not with this unit.

The default analog output curve is 0..5V for AFR 8.5 to 18.0.
