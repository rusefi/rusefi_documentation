TL,DR: we want to develop a much _smarter_ ECU. At the moment the two bottlenecks for us are:

a) software developers

b) actionable user feedback

As of February 2021, rusEFI has a LOT of potential but is far from easy to use.
1) rusEFI has a number of great hardware options and stable features. More information about particular features and their status can be found on the Wiki here:
https://github.com/rusefi/rusefi/wiki#features
2) As of February 2021, the focus of rusEFI is on tools, infrastructure and further development.  Attracting more developers is a goal.
3) In order to get more developers to contribute to rusEFI firmware and content, rusEFI Strategy 2020  was to provide kits and assembled units of highly flexible but large and not very cheap Proteus board.  rusEFI Strategy February 2021 is to provide the community with smaller and cheaper boards that can be assembled completely by automated methods which do not require as much labor from developers, allowing developers to focus on writing firmware and designing more hardware instead of building kits for new users.
5)   Some important tasks to be finished in 2021 are:<br>
     a. Move production of hardware sold by rusEFI to automated assembly, away from hand assembly.<br>
     b. Complete a Proteus board that fits into a standard ECU case (154 pin)<br>
     c. Incorporate results of Ion Sense testing conducted in 2020 to the spark control system<br>
     d. Improve Variable Camshaft control to allow more engines with this feature to run on rusEFI<br>
     e. Continue to improve documentation for development process, firmware, tuning and use<br>
4)  As of February 2021, 65 cars are listed as running on  https://github.com/rusefi/rusefi/wiki/List-of-engines-running-rusEFI
5)  As of February 2021, hundreds of rusEFI units have been sold in addition to any ECUs produced from our designs independently.   There is no true count of how many rusEFI derived devices are in the wild anymore.
6) As of February 2021  is is NOT the goal of rusEFI to market to a wide retail audience. The lack of documentation and the steep learning curve would cause a less than ideal user experience.  Developers continue to be the intended audience for the immediate future.
