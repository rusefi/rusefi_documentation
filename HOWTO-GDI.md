# How to GDI

Congratulations! You have PFI experience, a GDI engine and one of rusEFI's GDI boards!

* Calibrate the fuel rail pressure sensor atd confirm pressure is being built by the low pressure fuel pump
* Confirm that the HPFP valve is clicking using the bench test button - some pumps need higher than default peak/hold current
* Confirm the number of lobes on the cam which drives the pump
* Calibrate the actuating cam angle and confirm it by building pressure while rotating the engine with the starter
