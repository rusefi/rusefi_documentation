Two wire batch emulation: This is needed if your coils are individually wired and you wish to use batch injection.

### Coasting Fuel Cutoff Settings

![x](Overview/TS_generated/dialog_Coasting_Fuel_Cutoff_Settings.png)

Enable Coasting Fuel Cutoff: This setting disables fuel injection while the engine is in overrun, this is useful as a fuel saving measure and to prevent back firing.

TPS Deactivation Threshold(%): percent between 0 and 100 below which the fuel cut is deactivated, this helps low speed drivability.
