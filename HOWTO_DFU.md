DFU is Device Firmware Update mode - that's a way to update firmware via the same USB cable you use for rusEFI communication.

*Auto DFU* is when your rusEFI console switches your rusEFI device into DFU mode

*Manual DFU* mode is when you hold "Program" button while powering your rusEFI in order to switch it into DFU mode. This mode is
used to program brand new stm32 chips which do not have a running version of rusEFI firmware.
