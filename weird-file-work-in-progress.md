|ID|# of strokes| # of cam   | # of crank  | shape  |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|0_1E(xact)|4 strokes | 0 | 1  | exact angles known to rusEFI since shape is so simple|   |  z |
|1E_0|4 strokes | 1 | 0  | exact angles known to rusEFI since shape is so simple - 1/0 pattern or well-known signal with gap ratio|   |z   |
|1U(known)_0|4 strokes | 1 | 0  | exact angles NOT known - distributor 4/0 pattern for example, works with one coil |   |z   |
|1U_1E|4 strokes | 1 | 1  | relative cam position is not exactly known to rusEFI, exact cam position does not really matter or could be even variable like VVT  |   |  z |
|1E_1E|4 strokes | 1 | 1  | exact angles known to rusEFI (Neon 1995) |   |  z |
|2E_0|4 strokes| 2  | 0  | exact angles known to rusEFI (Miata NA) |   |   |
