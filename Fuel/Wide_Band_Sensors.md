# Wide Band Lambda Sensors - Also known as HEGO or WBO2 

A reliable measurement of the AFR is vital for the tuner to be able to tune the engine and be sure that his changes to the fueling are correct. For this purpose we recommend one of the readily available aftermarket wideband gauges or controllers. 

rusEFI is able to support most aftermarket wideband sensors that have a 5v analogue output.  
We have implemented the CAN interface for the new series of AEM X-type sensors, these have been tested to work with both their analog and CAN interfaces. 

Sensors that have been used with rusEFI so far include:
Innovate MTX-L
Innovate LC2 
Spartan SLC Free
AEM X-type WBO2 
AEM older generation WBO2
