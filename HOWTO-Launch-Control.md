<b>Enable LaunchControl:</b> true to enable/false for disable function

<b>Activation Mode:</b> - Switch Input

- Clutch Input: any time clutch is pressed, function would limit RPM
- Always Active (Disabled By Speed): once VSS registers a speed grather then preset value, function would disable.

<b>Rpm Treshold(RPM):</b> todo

<b>Speed Treshold(Kph):</b> if Activation mode is Always Active, while the vehicle speed is under this value, launch will limit max rpm as configured.

<b>Launch RPM (rpm):</b> RPM value to hold at launch, in this example 3000 RPM is used.

<b>Ignition Retard enabled:</b> in case this field is set to true, ignition would be retarded to the preset value in field Ignition Retard(deg).
<b>Ignition retard(deg):</b>: desired ignition value while we do launch. This value is used while engine in inside launch window. In the picture above 500 preset so that means from 2500 - 3000 the engine would run with 10 degree of ignition.

<b>Smooth Retard Mode:</b> while true, ignition would me smoothly retarded in the window 2500-3000. Final ignition advance is 10 degree, but it is only reached at 3000 rpm.

<b>Fuel Cut:</b> In case RPM would shoot over the target value, fuel cut to stop the engine to rev higher.

<b>Hard Cut:</b> launch limits engine while it revs in 2500 - 3500 window. If this value would be set to 1000, then rev limit window would be 2500 - 4000.
