## Plug 1 (ECU connector #2)

"rusEfi harness" does not mean much - that's just the way I bundle 4-5 wires together on my cars

## Starting & power

In start or run ECU is powered from Engine Fuse 15A (behind left side of dash) via 4S. (This is different from 2002 - nothing on 4S in 2002)

ECU controls main relay via 3H. (This is different from 2002 - nothing on 3H in 2002)

ECU gets +12v from main relay output 4AF which is used as +12v source for VVT (4D) and IAC (2P).

Fly-back diode - stripe facing +12 - is needed between VVT 4D (power, stripe side) and VVT control 4R.

Fly-back diode - stripe facing +12 - is needed between IAC 2P (power, stripe side) and IAC control 2Q.
