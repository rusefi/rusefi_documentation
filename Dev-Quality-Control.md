We love our engines and we want them to live a long & happy life. That's why we have a three-tier quality assurance process:

* Continuous Integration: Unit testing with [Github Actions](https://github.com/rusefi/rusefi/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Unit+Test+CI%22)
* built-in trigger signal simulation
* [Simulator](Virtual-simulator)

For current coverage report see https://rusefi.com/docs/unit_tests_coverage/
