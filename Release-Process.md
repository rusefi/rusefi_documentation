We have two kinds of firmware in rusEFI

* release builds more tested monthly-ish. Those do not change often. All releases at [https://github.com/rusefi/rusefi/releases](https://github.com/rusefi/rusefi/releases)
* snapshot builds available 20 minutes after developers make changes, sometimes more broken. Anything "I've just changed XXX" is a snapshot build.
All snapshots at [https://rusefi.com/build_server/](https://rusefi.com/build_server/)

We are moving away from the term "nightly" since rusEFI never had "nightly" builds as in once every 24 hours.

# No such thing as Latest

We avoid the term "latest" since it could mean both "latest RELEASE" and "LATEST snapshot". Please do not use the term "latest" in context of rusEFI binaries.
