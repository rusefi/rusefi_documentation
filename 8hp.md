## ISN Reset

When you install a used 8HP automatic transmission, its electronic control unit (TCU/EGS) is "locked" with the VIN and security data of the donor car. You cannot simply install it and code it to a new car. The TCU/EGS must first be reset to a factory state or "virginized."

## Power

A constant power wire is ideal to give the TCU time to preserve adaptations. Please use a 60 second time-delay relay if wired to switched power.  

## Shifter

F-series shifter
