# 8HP Transmission

## We focus on 1st generation BMW F-series transmissions

* BMW F-series is the most available option, great for swaps into older BMWs. Cheap and good enough!
* BMW 2nd generation like 8HP50 shift quicker but do not bolt into older BMWs. Feel free to donate a test vehicle for us to look into those!
* Chrysler/Dodge has interchangeable physical TCU, but totally different Chrysler CANbus dialect; some versions have a trans brake - but for now we just do not have resources to look into this. Feel free to donate a test vehicle for us to change the plan!
* BMW E-series CAN bus dialect, before ISN/Component Protection - there is not enough of these, that lowers the appeal.

## ISN Reset

When you install a used 8HP automatic transmission, its electronic control unit (TCU/EGS) is "locked" with the VIN and security data of the donor car. You cannot simply install it and code it to a new car. The TCU/EGS must first be reset to a factory state or "virginized."

## Power

A constant power wire is ideal to give the TCU time to preserve adaptations. Please use a 60 second time-delay relay if wired to switched power.
