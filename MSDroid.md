# MSDroid

Install [MSDroid](http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.msdroid)

Then you need to copy the rusefi.ini from your firmware bundle to your Android device.

Save the rusefi.ini file to the MSDroid/ini folder.

In order to connect msDroid to rusEFI you would need to tap 'App settings' and select the paired Bluetooth device. As of today, msDroid does not turn Bluetooth on automatically.
