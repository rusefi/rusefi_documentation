TODO: insert cranking dialog screenshot here

During cranking, two curves control the amount of fuel injected:
"cranking coolant temperature multiplier" and "cranking duration multiplier".
  
Colder engine usually requires more cranking fuel, cranking fuel usually tapers down during cranking since more fuel is needed in the beginning and not really needed later.

Of you have flooded your engine, i.e. got too much fuel on your spark plugs, "Cylinder Cleanup" is recommenced - i.e. cranking with wide open throttle without any fuel squired into the cylinders
in order to ventilate your cylinders.

As of April 2019 "base fuel pulse" is deprecated, "1" is recommended.



Typical 4 cylinder engine with 200 cc/min injectors, sequential injection, base fule = 1ms.

" = 1 is recomended these days, with correspodning change to cranking temperature multiplier)
