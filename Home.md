Hello, and welcome to the rusEFI wiki main page. Here you will find information related to rusEFI, a GPL open-source engine control unit for gasoline internal combustion engines. This project involves embedded hardware, software, and engines (vroom vroom). This community has many members from many walks of life who are scattered all around the world.

In order to use rusEFI you will need to acquire one of the [supported control units](Hardware). You can also design your own custom board if so desired.

## Get Started

Thinking of doing an engine control project? You have stopped by the correct place. The rusEFI project has many options that can likely help you out. We have several forum members with a wide variety of skills that are often willing to help people out. We have several hardware options as well. If a feature doesn't exist, inquire in the forums and it is likely that we can develop the feature. Or if you feel like giving something back, you can develop it yourself and share it with others.
