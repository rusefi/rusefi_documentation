In order to configure coolant temperature sensor or intake air sensor you would need to know it's resistance at three temperatures - lowest, highest and somewhere in between. You would also need to know the value of pull-up 'bias' resistor, which together with your sensor would make a voltage divider.

While troubleshooting CLT and IAT, the two most useful commands are `analoginfo` and `tempinfo` - these show you the voltage registered by rusEFI alongside with input pins and resistance processing values.
