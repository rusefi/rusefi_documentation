## Lada as harness donor

Complete used harness for Lada could be acquired pretty cheap in some parts of the world. On same Lada vehicles ECU
is in the cabin (unline Nissan ECU in dirty engine bay) so we get pretty clean crimped connector with about 30 wires already in
it. The missing wires could be taken from the smaller ECU connector.  

With a utility knife you need to cut 4 keys from inside the male part to mate default microRusEFI connector with a brown plug. Two center keys could be left
as is.
