3. A custom digital gauge cluster such as [uaDash](uaDASH) or [PiDGC](https://github.com/joshellissh/pidgc) ([Example on Josh's blog](https://mycustomcars.us/custom-digital-gauge-cluster/))
4. An Android tablet or phone running an app such as [Real Dash](http://realdash.net/index.php), [Shadow Dash](Shadow-Dash), or [MSDroid](MSDroid)
