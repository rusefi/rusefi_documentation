Mazda Miata MX5 NB2 2001-2005 Standalone

[microRusEFI](Hardware-microRusEfi) should be set for Hall

High-side jumper should be set for +12v.

[Some versions of Miata may need a jumper set on the board, See detail here](PNP-72-Jumpers)

### x4 AUX low-side drivers ###
There are 4 low-side drivers available. One is used for the alternator warning light on the dash. 
The following I/O is available. A jumper wire will need to be routed between the Jx hole on the board and the appropriate pin on the car-side connector. 
| Board   | stm32 pin  |
|---------|------------|
|   J3    |    PB8     |   
|   J1    |    PB9     |   
|   J2    |    PC12    |   

Extra pins for [353830-5 72 pin](https://rusefi.com/wiki/index.php?title=Hardware:OEM_connectors#72_pin): 

TE 316836-1 for 20 AWG to 22 AWG

TE 316838-1 for 16 - 18 AWG

Note the [latch on OEM ECU](installations/MazdaMiataNB2_Frankenso/nb2_ecu_plugs_latch.jpg) plugs while installing add-on pins.



### AV8 

In order to use this output as an analogue input requires the removal of the LED.

### OEM harness add-ons  
The OEM ECU connector uses AMP Multilock .040 and .070 pins. 

| Board   | stm32 pin  |   |
|-----|---|---|
| 3L  | AFR | Analog signal for external wide band oxygen controller |  
| 4U  | MAP| Manifold absolute pressure analog signal from [external sensor](GM-map-sensor) | 
| 4K  | +5v | +5v feed for MAP sensor |
| 3Z | GND | Sensor & USB ground | 

The NB2 OEM connectors are notoriously hard to depin. The link below is for a very useful guide.
