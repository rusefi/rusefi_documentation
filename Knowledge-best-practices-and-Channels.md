# Knowledge sharing and Channels

Are you interested in your knowledge being indexed by Google and outliving your rusEFI involvement? Are you interested in the social aspect of the [rusEFI Discord](Discord) lounge?

Please post your knowledge on the forum and report issues at [the GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/rusefi/rusefi/issues).

We have too many channels.

* [rusEFI Wiki](https://wiki.rusefi.com)
* [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/rusefi/rusefi/issues)
* [rusEFI Forum](https://rusefi.com/forum)
* [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/rusEfi)
* [Discord](Discord) (which has threads but humans rarely use threads)

Universal long term car knowledge: Wiki is probably the best place for this.

I have a cool project and I have knowledge specifec to it: Please create a thread on the forum - at least a summary.

## I Need Help

See [Support](Support)

## I have exciting valuable data I really want to dump into Discord RIGHT NOW

Please do not. Please help by not offloading data preservation on someone else. Please start on the forum or GitHub. Discord communications are only good for clarification and discussion *AFTER* context is nicely established on forum or GitHub.

## Should I pile everything together?

Please do not mix unrelated things together. For instance, let's not troubleshoot Mercedes vehicles on BMW build threads :)
