Q: Matt and Andrey are on Facebook, shall I message Matt or Andrey directly?

A: Unfortunately we do not have resources for technical support via Facebook direct messages.
Same about forum private messages. Please use public channels to have a higher chance of a response from the community. The more effort you make to ask a good question, the better response you would get. See also [HOWTO-ask-questions](HOWTO-ask-questions)

Q: how do I attach logs to my forum post? Looks like forum does not allow .msl files?

A: in TunerStudio, please use "Help->Create TunerStudio Debug Package" button - this would combine your tune and your logs.
Just make sure to remove the oldest unneeded logs from your DataLogs folder :)

 Please collect the below information before requesting support in the forums. Also please include this each time you post about a problem. This can all be collected in a zip file, or done as individual files and attached to your forum support request. Please keep in mind that you are seeing this and you have allot of information which those of us in the forum do not have. Things that may seem simple to you may be complicated for those of us who have not physically seen what you have, or have not see the steps you have taken to get to the problem you are faced with.

- What is the basic problem? This would be something like, engine does not start, cannot connect Tuner Studio, Magic smoke has come out, or something similar. A video can be helpful for this as well. 

- Please provide a picture of the rusEFI console. This tells us allot about what firmware you are using, and the status of your software. Also please include the console's border as that indicates information as well. 

- Please provide a picture of Tuner Studio. Just like the console, this indicates allot about your setup and which pieces of software you are using. Also please include the Tuner Studio border as that indicates information as well. 

- Please provide a picture of your physical setup. Seeing how the wires are connected tells us allot about how the hip bone is connected to the leg bone, etc. It also tells us if you have connected the leg bone to the shoulder bone. 

- Please provide a copy of your logs, or specify NA for this. 

- Please provide a copy of your tune, or specify NA for this. 

- Please tell us if you have updated your discovery firmware with the STLink tool. This is not the rusEFI firmware, but the discovery firmware. 

- Please tell us if you have installed the VCP drivers. 

- Please indicate your software pieces, commonly as noted below. The most common platform and the platform used by the primary software developer is Windows, so you are most likely to get the best support with a native Windows environment.
