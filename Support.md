Q: Matt and Andrey are on Facebook, shall I message Matt or Andrey directly?

A: Unfortunately we do not have resources for technical support via Facebook direct messages.
Same about forum private messages. Please use public channels to have a higher chance of a response from the community. The more effort you make to ask a good question,
 the better response you would get. See also [HOWTO_ask_questions](HOWTO_ask_questions)

Q: how do I attach logs to my forum post? Looks like forum does not allow .msl files?

A: in TunerStudio, please use "Help->Create TunerStudio Debug Package" button - this would combine your tune and your logs.
Just make sure to remove the oldest unneeded logs from your DataLogs folder :)
