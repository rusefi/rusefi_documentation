## Protoboard does not show the ON light

Isolate to only USB power by disconnecting from vehicle and plugging in to USB power. If that helps. There is probably a problem with the 12V power supply.
Check the 3.3V LED 

## ON light is bright, but can not communiate over USB

Check that the FTDI driver is installed and that you find your COM port. 

## Can't open Java console

Make sure you have Java installed and are opening with Java.
