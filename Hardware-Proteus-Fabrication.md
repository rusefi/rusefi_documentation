[Proteus](https://github.com/mck1117/proteus) is a 4 layer PCB measured 135mm x 82.5mm

[jlcpcb.com](http://www.jlcpcb.com) not only fabricates the PCB but also assembles a significant portion of Proteus pretty cheaply.

For best results take three official files from latest [export](https://github.com/mck1117/proteus/tree/master/export) folder

1) gerbers.zip for PCB files - On first step you point at this file and selec "PCB Assembly" checkbox.

2) Bill Of Materials for what components to assembled

3) placement file for where to place those components

TODO picture of Proteus as received from JLCPCB.

At QTY 10, each pre-assembled Proteus board costs under $40. DHL delivery is cheap and fast, you should have your 80% ready board in about 12 days!

The remaining components would cost you XXX more, BOM for final assembly is available at YYY.

As of May 2020 we have not figured out a great case solution.

Acceptable 3D printed case files are not public yet.

CNC files to cut holes in 1590wxxfl/1590xxfl cases are available at https://github.com/mck1117/proteus/blob/master/export/proteus-case.step
