We have some progress integrating with conventional knock sensors but it's not ready for end users.
We use TPIC/HIP9011 IC for knock sensor integration

We believe that we have hip9011 hardware yet nobody has ever actually detected knock with a hip9011, 
someone would have to figure our calibration approach and test the overall implementation.

Frankenso has hip9011 on-board 

TODO AndreiKA?


We also have ideas for knock sensor signal processor without specialised ICs but even hardware is not finished yet

TODO MattK



We also have some results with ion sensing but it's not ready for end users
